      "3. Pat dry: Gently pat the wound dry with a clean towel.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Basic Care**:\n",
      "1. Apply antibiotic ointment: Apply a thin layer of antibiotic ointment to the wound to help prevent infection.\n",
      "2. Cover the wound: Cover the wound with a sterile bandage or dressing to protect it from dirt and bacteria.\n",
      "3. Monitor for infection: Keep an eye on the wound for signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, increased pain, or pus. If you notice any of these symptoms, consult a doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      "**When to Seek Medical Attention**:\n",
      "If your son's wound is:\n",
      "* Deep or jagged\n",

      "* Not healing within a few days\n",
      "* Showing signs of infection\n",

      "\n",
      "If you're experiencing symptoms of depression, it's essential to consult with a healthcare provider, such as a primary care physician or a mental health specialist, like a psychologist or psychiatrist. They can help you determine the best course of treatment, which may include therapy, medication, or a combination of both.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime, here are some general steps you can take:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Reach out for support**: Talk to a trusted friend, family member, or loved one about how you're feeling. Sharing your emotions with someone you trust can help you feel less isolated and more supported.\n",
      "2. **Take small steps**: Engage in activities that bring you joy, even if it's just for a few minutes each day. This can help improve your mood and reduce symptoms of depression.\n",
      "3. **Get moving**: Regular exercise can help alleviate symptoms of depression. Try going for a short walk, doing some yoga, or engaging in another physical activity that you enjoy.\n",
      "4. **Practice self-care**: Make sure to get enough sleep, eat a balanced diet, and take breaks throughout the day to relax and recharge.\n",
      "\n",
